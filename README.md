## Description
A simple and fun project to flex a long dormant muscle. This is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It is a simple project that I am using to get back into the swing of things.

This will be the first version of many. Please feel free to inform me of any bugs by clicking on my linkedIn profile link on my github profile, and sending me a message. 

I got my inspiration from Asmr Coding, a youtube channel that I follow, their videos are clean and professional and quite impressive. Please go give them a subscribe to assist their growth. 

Enjoy.
